1. Installation

To build PMFpack, run

  cmake .
  make install

It is often useful to build PMFpack 'out-of-source' which means that
all files generated by the build process end up in a separate
directory without cluttering the source tree. To make an out-of-source
build for PMFpack using a graphical interface to CMake, simply type

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake-gui ..
  make install
